# 🌳 Git Practice Playground

**Welcome to the Git Practice Sandbox!** This repository is a safe environment designed for learning, testing, and experimenting with Git commands. The goal is to break things here so you don't break them in production.

## 🎯 Objectives
Use this repository to practice the following scenarios:

1.  **Basic Workflow:** Staging, committing, and pushing.
2.  **Branching:** Creating, switching, and deleting branches.
3.  **Merging:** Fast-forward vs. recursive merges.
4.  **Conflict Resolution:** Intentionally causing and fixing merge conflicts.
5.  **History Manipulation:** Using `rebase`, `reset`, and `amend`.
